The WIP_folder_maker script creates a new Archive Staging & Logs folders in the path you designate. This script has been updated to reflect GFS 1.0 .

The script prompts you to enter the path to a client level folder (e.g. /r2/hormeljobs). 

The script finishes up by setting appropriate ownership and permissions.
